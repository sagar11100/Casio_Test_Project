Casio Clone Website Project - Manual Testing Documentation
Introduction
This README provides a template and overview for conducting manual testing on the Casio Clone Website project, a web application designed to replicate the core functionalities of an e-commerce platform mimicking the official Casio website (https://casioclone.netlify.app/). The project includes features such as navigation, product categories, search and filter capabilities, purchase processes (add to cart, buy now), and user authentication (login, register, profile management). Manual testing is utilized to validate functionality, usability, and performance based on predefined test cases and scenarios, with a focus on addressing usability testing feedback and defect resolution. This document outlines the testing approach, environment, and resources required, incorporating data from test plans, test cases, execution reports, and defect logs provided.

Project Overview

Project Title: Casio Clone Website Project
Description: A web application replicating an e-commerce site with features like navigation & product categories, search & filter features, purchase process (add to cart, buy now), login, register, and profile management, hosted at https://casioclone.netlify.app/.
URL: https://casioclone.netlify.app/
Version: v1.0
Last Updated: April 21, 2025

Testing Objectives

Validate core functionalities such as navigation, search, purchase process, login, register, and profile features.
Ensure usability and accessibility across desktop and mobile devices.
Identify and document defects (e.g., missing add to cart, filter functionality issues) for resolution.
Verify compliance with user requirements and usability standards based on feedback.

Test Environment

Hardware: Desktop (Windows 10, MacOS), Mobile (iOS 15, Android 12)
Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
Network: Wi-Fi, 4G

Testing Approach

Methodology: Ad-hoc testing, exploratory testing, and scripted test case execution
Test Types: Functional, usability, regression
Test Execution: Conducted by manual testers following test cases (e.g., TC_N_001 to TC_P_004) from April 16, 2025 - April 18, 2025
Defect Reporting: Logged in a defect tracking system with severity levels (High, Medium, Low) based on defect report

Test Artifacts

Test Plan: Outlines testing strategy and schedule (April 15, 2025 - April 20, 2025)
Test Cases: Documented scenarios and steps in tabular form (e.g., TC_N_001: Verify cursor symbol, TC_S_003: Verify non-existing product search)
Test Execution Report: Summarizes results and defects (8 passed, 6 failed out of 14 test cases)
Defect Log: Tracks identified issues with status (e.g., DEF-001: No category info, DEF-003: Filter not working)

Getting Started

Setup: Clone the repository or access the live URL https://casioclone.netlify.app/
Prerequisites: Install required browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), access to test cases in Test_Cases.xlsx
Execution: Follow test cases (e.g., hover on tabs for TC_N_001, search "abbcdb" for TC_S_003), record results
Reporting: Submit findings to Sagar Vishwakarma, Test Engineer
